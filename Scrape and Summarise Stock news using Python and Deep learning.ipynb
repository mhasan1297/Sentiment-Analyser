       "'Renewed political tensions between the U.S. and China — which came to light this week as the Biden administration sat down with their Chinese counterparts for the first time to discuss a range of issues — could ensnarl vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA), which has pushed successfully into China in recent years. In fact, the heightened rhetoric between the two super economic superpowers may have already had blowback on Elon Musk\\'s electric car company. The Chinese government is restricting the use of Tesla vehicles by military staff and employees of vital state-owned companies, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Chinese officials reportedly have concerns that Tesla\\'s cars — outfitted with various data collecting capabilities — could serve as leakers of national security secrets. \"I have been saying for months now that Tesla\\'s level of integration of their business, of their research, of their sort of geo-tracking for which there is integration with Chinese maps, their development of A.I. with Chinese firms, and electric battery technology that\\'s not sustainable in China given the trajectory [on policy] that we are now on,\" policy expert and Eurasia Group founder Ian Bremmer said on Yahoo Finance Live. \"Most American A.I. and technology companies are seen as critical for national security, they don\\'t have access in China — companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. Tesla is the outlier.\" That outlier status has made China an incredibly important market for Tesla, and a key part of the investment thesis in the stock. Tesla\\'s sales in China clocked in at $6.66 billion in 2020, up 123% from a year earlier powered by strength in the Model 3. The business made up about 21% of Tesla\\'s overall 2020 sales. Tesla began deliveries of its China-made Model Y to Chinese consumers earlier this year. Bremmer warns Tesla now has a challenging road ahead in China in light of the recent development by the military. Musk\\'s response to the Chinese actions are important for investors to watch, suggests Bremmer. \"At a moment of some white knuckle tensions between the U.S. and China, Musk & Co. find themselves in a unique position (along with Apple) of being caught in the crossfire,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said. Tesla shares fell about 2% on the report, as investors pondered if China will take a harder line on Tesla\\'s sales to consumers. \"One thing we know about Elon Musk is that he is not'"

But once investors digested the results, GameStop shares\\xa0shrugged\\xa0off early declines. For the quarter ended on October 28th, GameStop reported revenue dropped 9% YoY of\\xa0$1.078\\xa0billion, coming short of analysts’ estimate of\\xa0$1.186 billion. GameStop reported a\\xa0net loss of $3.1 million, or 1 cent a share, improving from last year’s comparable quarter when net loss amounted to $94.7 million, or 31 cents a share. On an adjusted-per-share basis, GameStop broke even, which is better than the 8 cent loss that\\xa0FactSet\\xa0estimated. But, this achievement is mainly the result of\\xa0aggressive cost cuts, including European store closures and lowered selling, general and administrative expenses by\\xa023.6%\\xa0YoY to\\xa0$296.5 million.

Thursday, after going after Disney CEO Bob Iger yet again, this time calling for his firing, Tesla stock is up 1.3%. Musk\\'s dramatic takeover of Twitter, his turbulent management of X, and his inflammatory public remarks on world affairs in recent weeks have generated waves of distractions for his nearly $800 billion electric vehicle company, Tesla. And despite his inflammatory comments, Tesla is humming along. The stock\\'s robust performance — shares doubled in value so far this year — highlights one of Musk\\'s peculiar powers as a polarizing public figure. He can draw widespread criticism, even from some of his most outspoken boosters, but Tesla seemingly remains resilient. Part of the reason is because investors view the company as much more than an automaker. To its most optimistic backers, as former Publicis chief strategist Rishad Tobaccowala put it, it\\'s more like a next-generation energy company and a long play on the future of the grid and AI. But none of this means that there aren\\'t consequences to the fallout from Musk\\'s headline-grabbing interview at the New York Times (NYT) DealBook conference last month. They\\'re just not always immediately visible. One way to see these consequences is to think what would happen if Musk logged off X and focused on Tesla. \"I really think it\\'s unfortunate that his investment with X is such a conflict of interest for Tesla shareholders,\" Ross Gerber, a longtime Tesla bull and head of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, told Yahoo Finance Live. \"But there\\'s no doubt in my mind that it\\'s hurting Tesla.\" Gerber, whose company owns almost 400,000 shares of Tesla, equivalent to roughly $100 million, said Musk\\'s behavior is affecting people\\'s purchasing decisions. The company has lowered prices, and is offering customers deals on',\n",

       "  'If it feels like cyberattacks are becoming more frequent, it’s because they are. According to a new report by MIT professor Stuart Madnick, there were more ransomware attacks reported in the first nine months of 2023 than all of 2022. The report, which was funded by Apple (AAPL), but written independently by Madnick, points to a stark increase in cyberattacks, impacting as many as 360 million people through August. One reason for the jump, according to Madnick, is that ransomware groups are becoming more organized, operating as gangs and targeting organizations with critical user data such as government and healthcare facilities. The other cause for the jump, Madnick says, is that cybercriminals are increasingly using secondary vendors to gain access to their main targets. “In today’s interconnected world, virtually every organization relies on a wide range of vendors and software,” Madnick wrote. “As a result, hackers only need to exploit vulnerabilities in third-party software or a vendor’s system to gain access to the data stored by every organization that relies on that vendor.” Some 98% of business and government groups work in some capacity with a company that’s been hit by cybercriminals in the past year. The number of attacks is staggering. According to the study, 2.6 billion personal records were breached in 2021 and 2022, and 1 in 4 people had their health records exposed in the first three quarters of this year. Ransomware attacks against hospitals in particular can be dangerous, as they limit access to patient records and can force healthcare providers to divert potential patients to other hospitals. Attacks on hospitals ramped up significantly during the pandemic, and continue to wreak havoc across the US. According to a CBS News report, 299 hospitals have been hit with ransomware in 2023 as of the end of November. Madnick also points to a number of large-scale hacks in previous months, including 23andMe (ME), which gave notice for its breach in October; Discord, which was hacked in August; and Microsoft (MSFT), which took hits to its Outlook and Exchange platforms. Generative AI is also making phishing and ransomware attacks',\n",
       "  'In this article, we will take a look at the 11 cash-rich stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip our analysis of the recent trends, and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Cash-Rich Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. The top 75 non-banking stocks, based on their cash reserves, listed on major United States stock exchanges, held an aggregate of nearly $2.0 trillion of cash and equivalents and short-term investments on their balance sheet according to their latest publicly available financial results. Technology sector companies, and ecommerce companies combined accounted for the biggest share of this cash pile with reserves of nearly $858 billion. Out of these 75 companies, the 11 cash-rich stocks to buy according to hedge funds are sticking on a cash and short-term investments pile of a whopping $707 billion, more than the annual GDP of the majority of nations worldwide. This raises the question: why do companies carry so much cash? There are several factors that come into play when we look into ‘cash-hoarding’ tendencies of large (and small) corporations. Companies like to maintain a cash (and liquid assets) buffer to allow them to maneuver effectively, especially in times of economic uncertainty as available balances allow them to hold of layoffs or other similar measures in case of adversity. Companies looking for expansion, either organically through investments in R&D etc., or through merger & acquisition activities, have greater flexibility to manage the market conditions. A prime example is Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) recent acquisition of video game company, Activision Blizzard, Inc., completed in October, for a cash payment of $61.8 billion, net of cash acquired. A cash pile of nearly $144 billion as of September 30 enabled Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to pay the price from its own coffers. Most of the companies on our list are working on different programs to return cash to their shareholders. For instance, in addition to the massive acquisition, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) pays a regular quarterly dividend. The company also launched a share repurchase program in November 2021 with the authorization to repurchase $60 billion',\n",
